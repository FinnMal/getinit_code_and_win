This is my solution for the get in it coding challenge 2020/21. Further information can be found on the get-in-it page: https://www.get-in-it.de/coding-challenge
The submission deadline was January 10th, 2021, so no changes have been made to the project since then.

## The Task
The task was to drive two trucks to a location in Bonn and only have a limited capacity to deal with different devices as effectively as possible. The devices differ in "utility", weight and the required number in Bonn. The "utility" value indicates how urgently a certain device is needed. The devices and their values can be viewed here: https://www.get-in-it.de/imgs/it/codingCompetition/bwi/code_for_bwi.pdf
Added to this is the weight of the driver, which must be deducted from the total capacity of the truck.

This task is based on the so-called "bagpack" problem, which is one of the most complicated in computer science. In order to really get the most effective loading, an algorithm with a very long runtime is required, which is also dependent on the number of elements that have to be sorted. Here all possible combinations are checked and then the most effective is returned. I can recommend this solution for tasks with a small number of elements.

In order to load the trucks as effectively as possible, I therefore used a heuristic approach and implemented a simple variant of the greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm is characterized by its short runtime and comparatively good results.




First, the devices are sorted in descending order according to their effectiveness (see database.py l.46). The effectiveness of a device is determined by the ratio between weight and utility. The formula for this is ‚Äúeffectiveness = weight / utility value‚Äù. After sorting, the devices are packed into the truck, starting with the most effective. Depending on how much space is still available in the truck, not all units of a device are packed, or the algorithm jumps to the next element.

This results in the following loading lists:

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
